Put the pure-video.js file to a server accessible for you.
Then change the link to the pure-video.js in pure-video.html.
Open pure-video.html file and drag the link to your bookmarks bar.
When on a page with a video (test it on YouTube), click that bookmark.

TODO:
- prevent reloading of the video
- optionally change window size to video size
- try to remove address bar and such to save more space
- add some nice CSS3 to the video?
